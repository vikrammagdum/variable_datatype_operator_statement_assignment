
let y=8;//initialise the value....
y+=++y+y--+--y// assign the value...in given statement.. 
console.log(y)//output is 33


/*solve the programm=>
y+= means Y=y+y;
++y means value will be incremented and then saved..
y-- means value will be saved after used...


expresion is->
y=y+(++y (+) y--(+)--y)
y=8+(9)+(9)+(7)
y=33

++y means 8+1=9;
y-- means 9 as it is print then will be decremented =8
--y means  decrement the value(8-1)=7 and print..

thats it.....solve the problem
